# Software Design Patterns
Let's learn all type of software design patterns and their importance.

## Introduction
Design pattern is a very important section of Software Engineering, which is a general and reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. Rather than a complete finish product to code, it is a concept or idea or template that we are using in different situations to solve different problems in the process of software design.

### Different Design Patterns
All design patterns are grouped into 3 groups
* #### Creational Design Pattern

    * This design patterns deals with object creation mechanisms, which mechanism is suitable for the situation. 
    * Used in scenarios when system should not be dependant on, 'how objects are created?'.
    * The basic object creation technique may complecate the design and create complexity for developers, where creational design patterns solve this problem by controlling the object creation process.
    * This design patterns allows you to reuse other peopleâ€™s knowledge.
    * All Creational Design Patterns are based on two common ideas,
      * They encapsulate knowledge about which concrete class the system should use.
      * They hide, how instances of these concrete classes are created and combined.
    
* #### Structural Design Pattern

   * The Sructural Design Patterns ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize the relationship among entities.
   * Sructural Design Patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form large structure and provide new functionalies without any change in the existing design structure.
   * Structural Design Patterns depends on two programming concepts, Inheritance and Interface to allow multiple classes and objects to work togather and form a single working structure.
    
* #### Behavioural Design Pattern

   * Behavioural Design Patterns are concerned with object interaction and responsibilities
   * The interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled.
   * The implemantation and the client should be loosely coupledin order to avoid avoid hard coding and dependencies.
