# Software Design Patterns
Let's learn all type of software design patterns and their importance.

## Introduction
Design pattern is a very important section of Software Engineering, which is a general and reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. Rather than a complete finish product to code, it is a concept or idea or template that we are using in different situations to solve different problems in the process of software design.

### Different Design Patterns
All design patterns are grouped into 3 groups
* #### Creational Design Pattern

    * This design patterns deals with object creation mechanisms, which mechanism is suitable for the situation. 
    * Used in scenarios when system should not be dependant on, 'how objects are created?'.
    * The basic object creation technique may complecate the design and create complexity for developers, where creational design patterns solve this problem by controlling the object creation process.
    * This design patterns allows you to reuse other peopleâ€™s knowledge.
    * All Creational Design Patterns are based on two common ideas,
      * They encapsulate knowledge about which concrete class the system should use.
      * They hide, how instances of these concrete classes are created and combined.
    
* #### Structural Design Pattern

   * The Sructural Design Patterns ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize the relationship among entities.
   * Sructural Design Patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form large structure and provide new functionalies without any change in the existing design structure.
   * Structural Design Patterns depends on two programming concepts, Inheritance and Interface to allow multiple classes and objects to work togather and form a single working structure.
    
* #### Behavioural Design Pattern

   * Behavioural Design Patterns are concerned with object interaction and responsibilities
   * The interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled.
   * The implemantation and the client should be loosely coupledin order to avoid avoid hard coding and dependencies.

(*) - Important Software Design Patterns


1. #### Factory Method

   * Factory method design pattern uses a factory method as an interface to create objects instead of using a direct instantiation of objects, using 'new' keyword.
   * Define an interface or abstract class for creating an object and let the subclass decide which class to instantiate.
   * Also known as virtual constructor.
   * ##### Advantages
      * Allows the subclass to choose the type of object to create.
      * This promotes loose-coupling, i.e., objects are independent.
      * It eliminates the direct binding of application-specific classes to the code.
      * To achieve that, we use either an interface or an abstract class so that we can work with any class that is implementing this interface or abstract class.
      * We use this when a class doesn't know which subclass to instantiate.

   * Code Implementation
   
      Step 1: Trip.java, Interface

      ```java
      package com.eliza.common;

      public interface Trip {
         public void trip();
      }
      ```

      Step 2: AirTrip.java, RoadTrip.java, MerineTrip.java, all concrete classes
      
      AirTrip.java
      
      ```java
      package com.eliza.concreteClasses;

      import java.util.logging.Level;
      import java.util.logging.Logger;

      import com.eliza.common.Trip;

      public class AirTrip implements Trip{

         static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(AirTrip.class.getSimpleName());
         @Override
         public void trip() {
              logger.log(Level.INFO, logger.toString());

         }

      }
      ```
         
      RoadTrip.java
      
      ```java
      package com.eliza.concreteClasses;

      import java.util.logging.Level;
      import java.util.logging.Logger;

      import com.eliza.common.Trip;

      public class RoadTrip implements Trip {

         static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(RoadTrip.class.getSimpleName());
         @Override
         public void trip() {
              logger.log(Level.INFO, logger.toString());

         }

      }
      ```

      MerineTrip.java

      ```java
      package com.eliza.concreteClasses;

      import java.util.logging.Level;
      import java.util.logging.Logger;

      import com.eliza.common.Trip;

      public class MerineTrip implements Trip {

         static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(MerineTrip.class.getSimpleName());
         @Override
         public void trip() {
              logger.log(Level.INFO, logger.toString());

         }

      }
      ```

      Step 3: MakeMyTrip.java, Factory Class

      ```java
      package com.eliza.factoryClass;

      import com.eliza.common.Trip;
      import com.eliza.concreteClasses.AirTrip;
      import com.eliza.concreteClasses.MerineTrip;
      import com.eliza.concreteClasses.RoadTrip;

      public class MakeMyTrip {

         public Trip factoryMethod(String way) {
            if("FLY".equalsIgnoreCase(way)) {
               return new AirTrip();
            } else if("RUN".equalsIgnoreCase(way)) {
               return new RoadTrip();
            } else if("SWIM".equalsIgnoreCase(way)) {
               return new MerineTrip();
            }
            return null;
         }
      }
      ```

      Step 4: MyTrip.java, Client

      ```java
      package com.eliza.client;

      import com.eliza.common.Trip;
      import com.eliza.factoryClass.MakeMyTrip;

      public class MyTrip {

         public static void main(String[] args) {

            //AirTrip Object
            MakeMyTrip mmt = new MakeMyTrip();
            Trip myTrip = mmt.factoryMethod("fly");
            myTrip.trip();

            //RoadTrip Object
            myTrip = mmt.factoryMethod("run");
            myTrip.trip();

            //MerineTrip Object
            myTrip = mmt.factoryMethod("swim");
            myTrip.trip();
         }

      }
      ```
